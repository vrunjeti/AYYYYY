This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1.

## Setup

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

Run `npm install -g grunt-cli bower yo generator-karma generator-angular` first

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

To run server, `cd` into `/server`, run `npm install` if it's the first time, and run `nodemon server.js` to start the server.

You can use `node server.js` but I think you'll want to `npm install -g nodemon` and use `nodemon`

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
